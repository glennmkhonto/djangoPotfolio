# djangoPortfolio

Welcome to the portfolio I built with Django as a framework

NB: Make sure you install all requirements from the requirements.txt manually or run: pip install -r requirements.txt 

I wanted to run the code through the pipeline and configure it in Docker and create a make file but time is against me with the amount of work I have at work
